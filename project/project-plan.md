# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Relation between Global warming and Diseases

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How climate change affected increase in diseases?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Global warming is one of the most discussed topic for decades and many steps are taken to control it, but still we face a lot of climate change due to global warming. In this project, I try to find out which all gases contribute significantly to global warming and how global warming is affecting the health of human beings. I have 2 datasets: "PRIMAP-crf" have the data about the presence of different gases measured in different years, "A global dataset of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks" is the second dataset which contains data about diseases outbreaks. I plan to see if there is any relation to the changes in gases to these diseases.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: PRIMAP-crf
* Metadata URL: https://zenodo.org/records/4723476 , https://www.pik-potsdam.de/paris-reality-check/primap-crf/
* Data URL: https://zenodo.org/records/4723476/files/Guetschow-et-al-2021-PRIMAP-crf96_2021-v1.csv?download=1
* Data Type: CSV

PRIMAP-crf is a processed version of data reported by countries to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the Common Reporting Format (CRF). The processing has three key aspects:

* Data from individual countries and years are combined into one CSV file.
* Data is re-organised to follow the IPCC 2006 hierarchical categorisation.
* ‘Baskets’ of gases are calculated according to different global warming potential estimates from each of the three most recent IPCC reports.


### Datasource2: A global dataset of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks
* Metadata URL: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_global_dataset_of_pandemic-_and_epidemic-prone_disease_outbreaks/17207183/2
* Data URL : https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/37887318
* Data Type: CSV
* Based on journal : [A global dataset of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks][i2]
