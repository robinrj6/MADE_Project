# Relation between Climate Change and Disease

The main agenda of the project was to see if there is any relation between the emission rate of green-house gases and number of new diseases reported. After data cleaning and transformation, I have used the resulting dataset to plot 2 graphs which maps Averaged Emissions and Number of Diseases on y-axis of the graphs and year on x-axis for both graphs. The graph which plots the emission to year follows a negative trend for most of the gases while the diseases to year graph is scattered. The final result is that I couldn’t find a relation between these 2 factors as even though the average emissions decline, the number of diseases reported are scattered and doesn’t follow any trend.

All project related files can be found inside the /project directory.
